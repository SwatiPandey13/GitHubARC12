Azure DevOps (ADO) CD Automation

Onboarded Azure DevOps (ADO) and created an end-to-end proof of concept (POC) demonstrating automated deployment using Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Set up both Linux and Windows build agents to validate the automation of deployment using existing codebases.

Containerized the Azure DevOps agents using Dockerfiles, custom images, and Podman to dynamically spin up and spin down agents based on pipeline load and frequency.

GitHub Enterprise CI/CD Automation:

Currently working on onboarding GitHub Enterprise and exploring how to automate build pipelines using GitHub Workflows.

Collaborated with the Platform team to implement GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC) to auto-scale GitHub runners based on workload.

Configured existing Linux and Windows virtual machines as self-hosted GitHub runners to validate workflows and ensure GitHub Actions operate correctly.

Developing reusable container images preconfigured with essential build tools (e.g., Maven, .NET, Node.js, etc.) to support multi-technology application builds without the need to install software at runtime.
